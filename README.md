### Dia dhaoibh!
I'm Alan. I'm a technical writer for [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) based in Dublin, Ireland.

My username is based on my name as Gaelige; Ail√≠n O'Dubhlaoich is ainm dom.

I don't spend very much time curating my GitHub profile - checking out [my website](https://www.adubhlaoich.ie/) is probably the best way to learn about me.

My main hobby is swing dancing, and I'm pretty passionate about tabletop RPGs, too.

You can contact me through [Mastodon](https://mastodon.ie/@adubhlaoich) or my e-mail address, which can be found on my website.

Sl√°n!
